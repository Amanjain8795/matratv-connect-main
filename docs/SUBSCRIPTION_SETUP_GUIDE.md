# MATRATV CARE Subscription System Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up and configure the subscription system for MATRATV CARE.

## üèóÔ∏è Database Setup

### 1. Run the Subscription Schema

Execute the SQL script in `docs/SUBSCRIPTION_SCHEMA.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor to create all necessary tables, policies, and functions.

```sql
-- The script includes:
-- - subscription_status column in user_profiles
-- - subscription_requests table
-- - subscription_plans table  
-- - user_subscriptions table
-- - RLS policies
-- - Storage bucket for payment proofs
-- - Helper functions
```

### 2. Default Settings

By default, existing users are set to 'active' subscription status for smooth migration. To require subscriptions for all users, comment out this line in the schema:

```sql
-- UPDATE user_profiles SET subscription_status = 'active' WHERE subscription_status IS NULL;
```

## üí∞ Subscription Configuration

The system includes a default subscription plan:
- **Name**: Premium Annual Plan
- **Price**: ‚Çπ99.00
